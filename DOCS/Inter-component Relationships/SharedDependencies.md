# Shared Dependencies

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the shared dependencies within the application designed for enhancing user engagement at events. These dependencies are crucial for the maintainability and scalability of the application.

## Application Overview

Refer to [Overview.md](../Introduction/Overview.md) for a comprehensive understanding of the application's goals, audience, and the technology stack used.

## Core Business Logic

The core business logic is defined in the `DataModelSchema` and `BusinessLogicFunctions`. These are essential for the application's operations and are used across various modules.

- Data Models: See [Entities.md](../Core%20Business%20Logic/Entities.md) for the schema definitions.
- Business Logic: Functionality is detailed within the business logic layer, which interacts with use cases and data conversion layers.

## Business Processes

Business processes are described in `UseCaseDescriptions`. These processes dictate the flow of operations and are integral to the application's functionality.

- Use Cases: Documented in [UseCases.md](../Business%20Processes/UseCases.md), they outline the application's business processes.

## Data Conversion and User Interface

`InterfaceComponentIDs` and `DataConversionFunctions` are used to bridge the gap between the user interface and the business logic.

- Interface Adapters: For more information, refer to [InterfaceAdapters.md](../Data%20Conversion%20and%20User%20Interface/InterfaceAdapters.md).

## External Communication

`ExternalAPIEndpoints` are utilized for communication with external services, which are critical for the application's integration with third-party systems.

- Frameworks and Drivers: Detailed in [FrameworksAndDrivers.md](../External%20Communication/FrameworksAndDrivers.md).

## Security and Authentication

`SecurityProtocolNames` ensure the application's security, protecting user data and managing access control.

- Security Protocols: See [SecurityProtocols.md](../Security%20and%20Authentication/SecurityProtocols.md) for the security measures in place.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

`TestingMethodNames` are employed to ensure the application's reliability and performance.

- Testing Methods: Evaluation of these methods can be found in [TestingMethods.md](../Testing%20and%20Quality%20Assurance/TestingMethods.md).

## Build Process and Dependency Management

The build process utilizes `BuildAutomationScripts` and manages `DependencyList` to streamline development and deployment.

- Build Procedures: Documented in [BuildProcedures.md](../Build%20Process%20and%20Dependency%20Management/BuildProcedures.md).

## Additional Functional Components

`SupplementaryModuleNames` are additional features that enhance the application's capabilities.

- Supplementary Features: Further information is available in [SupplementaryFeatures.md](../Additional%20Functional%20Components/SupplementaryFeatures.md).

## Conclusion and Architectural Insights

`ArchitecturalDesignPatterns` are evaluated to provide insights into the application's architectural design.

- Architectural Assessment: Concluding thoughts are presented in [ArchitecturalAssessment.md](../Conclusion%20and%20Architectural%20Insights/ArchitecturalAssessment.md).

## Documentation Assembly and Organization

A `MaintenanceStrategy` is in place to ensure the documentation is kept up-to-date with the ongoing changes in the codebase.

- Documentation Organization: The strategy for maintaining the documentation is outlined in [DocumentationOrganization.md](../Documentation%20Assembly%20and%20Organization/DocumentationOrganization.md).

The shared dependencies listed above are critical for the application's cohesion and must be consistently managed to ensure the system's integrity. Regular reviews and updates to these dependencies are necessary to maintain the application's robustness.
