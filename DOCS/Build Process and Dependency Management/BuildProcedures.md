# Build Process and Dependency Management

The build process is a critical component of our application's development lifecycle. It ensures that the source code is compiled, tested, and packaged in a way that is ready for deployment. This document outlines the procedures and tools used in the build process for our application, which is designed for enhancing user engagement at events.

## Build Automation

To automate our build process, we use `BuildAutomationScripts` that are designed to handle various tasks such as compiling the code, running tests, and packaging the application. Below is an example of a build script that could be used in our application:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Clean the previous build artifacts
rm -rf build/
mkdir build

# Compile the source code
echo "Compiling the source code..."
javac -d build src/main/java/com/eventapp/*.java

# Run unit tests
echo "Running unit tests..."
java -cp build org.junit.runner.JUnitCore com.eventapp.tests.UnitTestSuite

# Package the application into a JAR file
echo "Packaging the application..."
jar cvfe build/eventapp.jar com.eventapp.Main -C build com

echo "Build completed successfully."
```

## Dependency Management

Our application relies on a set of third-party libraries and frameworks, which are managed using a dependency management tool. The `DependencyList` is maintained in a configuration file, typically `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle. Here is an example of how dependencies might be specified in a Maven `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Example dependency: JUnit for testing -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>junit</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
        <version>4.13.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Additional dependencies can be added here -->
</dependencies>
```

## Continuous Integration

We use a continuous integration (CI) system to automatically build and test the application upon each commit to the repository. The CI configuration file, such as `.travis.yml` for Travis CI or `Jenkinsfile` for Jenkins, defines the build environment and the steps to execute:

```yaml
language: java
jdk:
  - openjdk11

script:
  - ./BuildAutomationScripts/build.sh
```

## Conclusion

The build process is designed to be robust and repeatable, ensuring that our application is always in a deployable state. By automating the build, testing, and packaging steps, we minimize human error and increase the efficiency of our development workflow. The use of dependency management tools ensures that we have a consistent and up-to-date set of libraries that our application depends on.
