Shared Dependencies:

1. `ApplicationOverview`: Information about the application's purpose, audience, and technology stack used across multiple documents for context.
2. `DataModelSchema`: The schema definitions for the core business entities that are referenced in business logic, use cases, and data conversion.
3. `BusinessLogicFunctions`: Function names and descriptions that encapsulate the core business logic, used in entities, use cases, and interface adapters.
4. `UseCaseDescriptions`: Descriptions of business processes that interact with the core business logic and interface adapters.
5. `InterfaceComponentIDs`: ID names for DOM elements that are manipulated by JavaScript functions in the user interface.
6. `DataConversionFunctions`: Function names for converting data between formats, used in interface adapters and potentially in testing.
7. `ExternalAPIEndpoints`: Names of external API endpoints and their specifications, used in frameworks and drivers.
8. `SecurityProtocolNames`: Names of security protocols and authentication mechanisms, referenced in security documentation and potentially in testing.
9. `TestingMethodNames`: Names of testing methods and strategies, which may be referenced in quality assurance and potentially in build processes.
10. `BuildAutomationScripts`: Names of scripts and tools used for build automation, referenced in build process documentation.
11. `DependencyList`: A list of dependencies that are shared across components, referenced in build process and shared dependencies documentation.
12. `DocumentationFileNames`: The naming convention for Markdown files, ensuring consistency across the documentation structure.
13. `SupplementaryModuleNames`: Names of additional functional components or modules that are part of the application, referenced in the corresponding documentation.
14. `ArchitecturalDesignPatterns`: Names of design patterns and architectural styles used in the application, referenced in the conclusion and architectural insights.
15. `MaintenanceStrategy`: A strategy for maintaining documentation, which may be referenced in the documentation assembly and organization section.

These shared dependencies are the common threads that tie the various documentation files together, ensuring consistency and coherence in the documentation of the application's architecture and codebase.
